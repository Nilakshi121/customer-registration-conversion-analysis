📊 Customer Registration & Conversion Insights (SQL Project)
🚀 Project Snapshot
This project demonstrates how SQL can power data-driven growth strategies by analyzing customer registrations, conversions, and engagement behavior.
Instead of just querying data, I translated raw tables into actionable business insights—the kind that help companies understand:

* Where customers come from
* How quickly new users convert
* Which channels drive the highest ROI
* Where potential churn risks emerge

✅ Built to showcase SQL expertise in business KPIs, optimization, and time-based analysis.

🎯 Why This Matters
Every company asks:

* Are we getting enough sign-ups?
* How many actually convert into paying users?
* Which marketing channels are worth the spend?
* Do customers stick with us, or churn after the first purchase?

This project answers those questions in a recruiter-friendly and client-relevant way—making it a perfect example of how I solve real business problems with SQL.

🗄️ Data Model
The analysis is based on three core tables:

* customers – registration details and purchase history
* channels – acquisition sources (Organic, Paid Ads, Referral…)
* orders – order-level breakdown (dates + amounts)


🔑 Example Analyses
📅 1. Registration Trends (Time-based Growth)
How many users registered in the first half of 2017?
sqlDownloadCopy code WrapSELECT COUNT(*) AS registration_count
FROM customers
WHERE registration_date BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-06-30';
💳 2. Conversion Rate Calculation
Measure what % of new users went on to make their first purchase.
📈 3. Channel Performance
Compare conversion trends across Organic, Paid Ads, and Referrals.
⏳ 4. Time-to-First Purchase
Understand how quickly customers become paying users after signing up.
🔍 5. Churn Signals
Spot patterns of “quick converters” who later went inactive.

🧩 Tech Stack

* SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) – optimized queries & joins
* Database Design & Normalization – handling multiple fact/dimension tables
* Analytical KPIs – conversion rates, engagement trends
